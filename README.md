# Interactive Dashboard using Dash and ngrok

I created an integrated dashboard for analyzing café sales using the **Python Dash library**, integrating the **Plotly** interactive charting library and **dash-bootstrap-components** to design an attractive interface.

## 💡 What did I do?

Cleaned and processed sales data (item, location, payment method, date...).

Created performance indicators (total revenue, number of orders, number of products sold).

Added interactive filters (by item, payment method, and transaction date).

Designed interactive charts that illustrate:

Sales by item

Revenue change over time

Distribution of payment methods

🌐 To easily share the dashboard, I used the **[ngrok]** service to temporarily publish the application online and share it via a direct link, making reports accessible from anywhere without the need for dedicated servers.
